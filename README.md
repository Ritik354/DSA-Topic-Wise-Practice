# 📚 DSA Topic-Wise Practice

Welcome to my **DSA Topic-Wise Practice** repository!  
This repo contains my solutions to problems from **Coder Army's DSA Sheet**, organized by topics. I’m on a mission to **master Data Structures and Algorithms** and use this space to **track my progress, share my solutions, and document my learnings**. 🚀

## 📝 How I Approach Problems

1. **Understand** the problem statement and constraints
2. **Plan** the solution — start with brute force, move to optimized
3. **Code** with clarity — write clean, modular, and well-commented code
4. **Analyze** time and space complexity
5. **Test** with sample inputs and edge cases
6. **Document** the final solution in this repository
