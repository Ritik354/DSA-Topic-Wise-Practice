## Q17 - Find Peak Element

## Problem -A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findPeakElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        // Handle edge cases
        if (n == 0) return -1;           // Empty array
        if (n == 1) return 0;            // Single element is a peak
        if (nums[0] > nums[1]) return 0; // First element is a peak
        if (nums[n-1] > nums[n-2]) return n-1; // Last element is a peak

        // Binary search for peak in range [1, n-2]
        int start = 1, end = n - 2;
        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            // Check if mid is a peak
            if (nums[mid] > nums[mid-1] && nums[mid] > nums[mid+1]) {
                return mid;
            }
            // Move to right if left neighbor is smaller (increasing slope)
            else if (nums[mid] > nums[mid-1]) {
                start = mid + 1;
            }
            // Move to left if left neighbor is larger (decreasing slope)
            else {
                end = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return -1; // Unreachable due to problem constraints
    }
};
```
