## Q18 - Find Transition Point

## Problem - Given a sorted array, arr[] containing only 0s and 1s, find the transition point, i.e., the first index where 1 was observed, and before that, only 0 was observed.  If arr does not have any 1, return -1. If array does not have any 0, return 0.

## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int transitionPoint(vector<int>& arr) {
        // code here
        int n = arr.size();
        if(arr[0]==1) return 0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(arr[i]==1){
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```
