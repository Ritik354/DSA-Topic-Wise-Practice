## Q12 - Greater on right side


## Problem -You are given an array arr. Replace every element with the next greatest element (the greatest element on its right side) in the array. Note: There is no element next to the last element, so replace it with -1.
---
Example:

Input: arr[] = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]
Output: [17, 5, 5, 5, 2, -1]
Explanation: For 16 the greatest element 
on its right is 17. For 17 it's 5. 
For 4 it's 5. For 3 it's 5. For 5 it's 2. 
For 2 it's -1(no element to its right).
---
## Code
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    /* Function to replace every element with the
    next greatest element */
    vector<int> nextGreatest(vector<int> arr) {
        // code here
        int n = arr.size();
        int greatest = -1;
        for(int i=n-1;i>=0;i--){
            int temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] =  greatest;
            greatest = max(greatest,temp);
        }
        return arr;
    }
};
```
