## Q15 - Sort 0s, 1s and 2s


## Problem -Given an array arr[] containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s. Sort the array in ascending order.You need to solve this problem without utilizing the built-in sort function.

## Approach-
***Dutch National Flag*** 
The problem is similar to “Segregate 0s and 1s in an array”. The idea is to sort the array of size n using three pointers: lo = 0, mid = 0 and hi = n – 1 such that the array is divided into three parts –


arr[0] to arr[lo – 1]: This part will have all the zeros.
arr[lo] to arr[mid – 1]: This part will have all the ones.
arr[hi + 1] to arr[n – 1]: This part will have all the twos.

Here, lo indicates the position where next 0 should be placed, mid is used to traverse through the array and hi indicates the position where next 2 should be placed.

bs low = 0 , mid = 0 , high = n-1 
if(arr[mid] == 0){
    swap low and mid 
    aur low ++ mid++
}else if(arr[mid]== 1) {
    mid++
}else{
    swap high and mid 
    high--
    mid++
}
## Code
```cpp
void sort012(vector<int>& arr) {
        // code here
        int n = arr.size();
        int low = 0,mid = 0,high = n-1;
        while(mid<=high){
            if(arr[mid]==0){
                swap(arr[low],arr[mid]);
                low++;
                mid++;
            }else if(arr[mid]==1){
                mid++;
            }else{
                swap(arr[high],arr[mid]);
                high--;
            }
        }
    }
```
