üìù Problem Statement
Given two arrays a[] and b[] of equal size, the task is to find whether the elements in the arrays are equal.
---
Two arrays are said to be equal if both contain the same set of elements, arrangements (or permutations) of elements may be different though.
---
Note: If there are repetitions, then counts of repeated elements must also be the same for two arrays to be equal.

```cpp

// User function template for C++

class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to check if two arrays are equal or not.
    bool checkEqual(vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) {
        // code here
        int n = a.size();
        sort(a.begin(),a.end());
        sort(b.begin(),b.end());
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(a[i]!=b[i]){
                return 0;
            }
        }
        return 1;
    }
};
