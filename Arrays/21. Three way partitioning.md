## Q21 - Three way partitioning


## Problem - Given an array and a range a, b. The task is to partition the array around the range such that the array is divided into three parts.
1) All elements smaller than a come first.
2) All elements in range a to b come next.
3) All elements greater than b appear in the end.
The individual elements of three sets can appear in any order. You are required to return the modified array.

## Code
```cpp
void threeWayPartition(vector<int>& arr, int a, int b) {
        // code here
        int n = arr.size();
        int i=0,low=0,high=n-1;
        while(i<=high){
            if(arr[i]<a){
                swap(arr[i],arr[low]);
                i++;
                low++;
            }else if(arr[i]>b){
                swap(arr[high],arr[i]);
                high--;
            }else{
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
```
