📝 Problem Statement 
---
-Given an array arr of n integers and an integer element x, determine if x exists in the array. Return the index of the first occurrence of x, or -1 if it is not found.
---
Example:

Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], n = 5, x = 3
Output: 2 (3 is at index 2)
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3], n = 3, x = 6
Output: -1 (6 is not in the array)
---
💻 Solution 
```Cpp#
include <vector>
using namespace std;

int search(vector<int>& arr, int x) {
    // Linear search through the array
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        if (arr[i] == x) {
            return i; // Return index of first occurrence
        }
    }
    return -1; // Return -1 if x is not found
}
```


🚀 Approach

Linear Search: Iterate through the array from index 0 to n-1.
If arr[i] == x, return i (first occurrence).
If no match is found, return -1.

⏰ Complexity

Time Complexity: O(n) - Scans the entire array in worst case.
Space Complexity: O(1) - Uses constant extra space.

🔑 Key Points

Returns the first occurrence of x.
Works for positive, negative, or zero values.
Handles edge cases: empty array or x not present (-1 returned).
Simple and efficient for small or unsorted arrays.
